# SQL_HR_Data
Design tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. We accomplished this by:

1. Data Modeling: Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

2. Data Engineering:Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files,import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

3. Data Analysis: Run multiple queries to answer questions about the HR data.
